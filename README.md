# Pico

# This is a one level (intended to have more levels in the future) game paying homage to old school computer games like Pacman
# The story is as follows: Pico, a brainbot, must fight Python the snake to get to the next level

# The "left" and "right" arrow keys move PicoGirl and the "a" and "s" keys move Python the Snake

# Just run game.py and voila! Sometime in the near future, more levels might be added, and the first level will be extended into multiple frames as right now, it is only one frame. 

# Enjoy!
